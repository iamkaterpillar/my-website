    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Kat! I'm a California-raised girl living in London. I moved here for my MBA at London Business School, met my husband while working at Wintermute, and somehow got stuck in the UK (for now).</p>

    <p>By day, I work in product at a crypto startup called Bebop. I’m not technical (yet), but I keep ending up as the only non-engineer in very technical teams. I like to think it’s because I’m the glue that keeps things running — or maybe just because I’m a bit obsessed with structure, lists, and solving chaos. I’m a zero-inbox person, always organizing, and never without a to-do list.</p>

    <p>This site is a little experiment. I’m setting it up to learn how to make a website — and maybe share a few things I’ve learned along the way, so I don’t forget them.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🛠 Product @ Bebop</li>
      <li>📝 Writing things I’ve learned (mostly for future me)</li>
      <li>🤖 Learning to code with the help of AI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>☀️ Chasing sunshine</li>
      <li>✈️ Travel</li>
      <li>💪 Pilates girlie</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools I’m Using</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>VS Code (still learning it, might get Cursor)</li>
      <li>iTerm</li>
      <li>Apple Notes (but thinking about switching to Obsidian…)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>I have my scuba instructor license… even though I’ve never actually used it to teach anyone. I just really like being underwater.</p>
