  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Hiya, I'm Kat! I'm a California-raised girl living in London. I moved here for my MBA at London Business School, met my husband while working at Wintermute, and somehow got stuck in the UK (for now).</p>

  <p>I work in product at a crypto startup called Bebop. I wouldn’t call myself technical (yet), but I’m usually surrounded by engineers - both at work and outside of it. I like to think it’s because I’m the glue that keeps things running… or maybe just because I’m a bit obsessed with structure, lists, and bringing order to chaos. I’m a zero-inbox kind of person, always organizing, and never without a to-do list.</p>

  <p>This site is a little experiment. I’m setting it up to learn how to build a website — and maybe to share some things I’ve learned in my career and along the way, so I don’t forget them.</p>

    <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🛠 Product @ Bebop</li>
      <li>📝 Writing things I’ve learned (mostly for future me)</li>
      <li>🤖 Learning to code with the help of AI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outside of work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>☀️ Chasing sunshine</li>
      <li>✈️ Travel whenever I can</li>
      <li>💪 Pilates girlie</li>
      <li>🚴‍♀️ Cycling around London</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools I’m using</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cursor AI (migrated from VS Code per everyone's recommendation)</li>
      <li>Apple Notes (using it for quick thoughts, but considering a switch to Obsidian…)</li>
      <li><s>iTerm</s> (but I'm using terminal in Cursor now)</li>
      <li>Google Analytics (who doesn't love a good analytics tool?)</li>
      <li>Github (for storing code and hosting this site)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fun fact</h2>
    <p>I have my scuba instructor license… even though I’ve never actually used it to teach anyone. I just really like being underwater.</p>

    <h2>Connect with me</h2>
