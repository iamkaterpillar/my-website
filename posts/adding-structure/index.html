<h1>Adding structure</h1>

<p>When you’re just starting a personal site or blog, it’s tempting to toss everything into one folder and call it a day. But if you think your project might grow — even just a little — it’s worth taking a moment early on to build structure into your setup.</p>

<p>That’s what this post is about: setting up a neat, scalable file structure from the beginning to make things easier later.</p>

<h2>Why structure matters</h2>

<p>Right now, my site only has a few pages. But I know I’m going to be adding more blog posts, some images, and likely other resources (scripts, analytics tools, maybe even interactive pages). Without a clear structure, things could quickly get messy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to find files</li>
  <li>Duplicate images or assets</li>
  <li>Confusing link paths</li>
  <li>Refactoring pain when things grow</li>
</ul>

<p>So instead of deferring that cleanup to “someday,” I decided to do it now.</p>

<h2>What I set up</h2>

<p>I landed on a simple but clean structure:</p>

<pre><code>my-website/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── blog.html
├── post.html
├── posts/               # All blog post content lives here
│   ├── usage-analytics/
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   └── thumb.jpg
│   ├── website-setup/
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   └── thumb.jpg
│   └── adding-structure/
│       ├── index.md
│       └── thumb.jpg
├── assets/              # Site-wide assets
│   ├── images/
│   │   └── icons/
│   │       └── favicon.ico
│   ├── fonts/
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── posts.json           # Blog post metadata for rendering
└── CNAME                # For custom domain
</code></pre>

<h3>Why images go with posts</h3>

<p>One of the decisions I spent time on was whether to put blog post images (like thumbnails) inside a global <code>assets/</code> folder or right next to the <code>.md</code> file for the post.</p>

<p>I decided to keep post-specific assets <em>with the post itself</em>. Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easier to move/delete/edit posts later without breaking things</li>
  <li>Keeps global <code>assets/</code> clean and focused on site-wide assets</li>
  <li>Everything related to a blog post lives together, which just feels right</li>
</ul>

<p>If I had to migrate this blog to another system or export a post, I’d want it to be self-contained.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This kind of structure might feel like overkill when you only have three blog posts and a favicon, but it’s a gift to your future self. I’d rather spend 10 extra minutes now than have to refactor everything in a month.</p>

<p>If you’re building your own site and wondering whether to invest time in structure early on — I say yes. It keeps your project organized, easier to debug, and ready to scale if inspiration hits ✨</p>
