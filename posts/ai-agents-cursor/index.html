<h1>Using AI agents in Cursor</h1>
<p>When I first started building this website, I was using VS Code—but I wouldn’t say I was comfortable with it. Everything felt unfamiliar, and I was relying heavily on ChatGPT to walk me through each step.</p>
<p>After hearing a lot of people recommend <strong>Cursor</strong>, I figured it was worth upgrading and giving it a try. I liked the interface right away, but at first, I didn’t even think to explore the AI agents. I was mostly just using it like a smarter version of VS Code.</p>
<p>Recently though, I finally started digging into the AI features—and it’s been a game changer.</p>

<h2>What is Cursor?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cursor.so/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> is an AI-native IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Think of it as VS Code, but with superpowers. It’s designed from the ground up to integrate AI into your workflow—whether that’s writing new code, debugging issues, or learning as you go.</p>

<h2>How I’m using AI agents</h2>
<p>Here’s how I’ve been using Cursor’s AI agents to build and improve this site:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Code cleanup:</strong> The AI helps tidy up formatting, catch inconsistencies, and suggest clearer patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature implementation:</strong> When adding new features, it recommends best practices and even scaffolds out clean, efficient code.</li>
  <li><strong>Bug fixing:</strong> I can paste error messages or describe weird behavior, and it often points me directly to the fix.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning:</strong> The AI doesn't just give solutions—it explains them. That’s been huge for leveling up my understanding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recent improvements (thanks to Cursor)</h2>
<p>Some tangible improvements I’ve made recently with the help of Cursor’s AI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reorganized the file structure for better clarity and scalability</li>
  <li>Added meta tags for SEO and social previews</li>
  <li>Implemented responsive design patterns for mobile friendliness</li>
  <li>Created a reusable styling system using utility classes</li>
  <li>Added social media icons using clean, lightweight SVGs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for working with AI agents</h2>
<p>If you’re new to using AI in your dev workflow, here are a few things I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Vague prompts = vague results. Tell the AI exactly what you need.</li>
  <li><strong>Stay in control:</strong> Don’t blindly accept suggestions—use them as a starting point, and verify everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask “Why?”:</strong> Let the AI teach you. It’s a surprisingly good mentor when prompted to explain.</li>
  <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Try it on low-risk tasks first. You’ll build trust over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s next: other AI tools I want to explore</h2>
<p>Now that I’ve started using AI agents in Cursor, I’m excited to try out more tools that can streamline different parts of the development process. Here are a few on my radar:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Balsamiq</strong></a> – For wireframing and sketching out UI ideas quickly</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.chatprd.ai/" target="_blank"><strong>ChatPRD</strong></a> – To help structure and iterate on product requirement documents</li>
  <li><a href="https://devin.ai/" target="_blank"><strong>Devin</strong></a> – The so-called “AI software engineer”—I’m curious how it holds up in practice</li>
  <li><a href="https://windsurf.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Windsurf</strong></a> – An AI-powered IDE that helps you understand large codebases and collaborate in real-time</li>
  <li><a href="https://bolt.new/" target="_blank"><strong>Bolt</strong></a> – A browser-based AI agent that lets you prompt, run, and deploy full-stack apps with zero local setup</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m still early in exploring what AI can do for solo builders like me, but it’s already made a big difference in how I approach coding—and how much I enjoy it.</p>
