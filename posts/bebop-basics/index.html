<h1>Bebop basics</h1>

<p>So what is Bebop? Simply put, Bebop as we describe it is a trading app and a suite of APIs that finds the best route for your trades. Quick, secure, any tokens in any size, at the best prices.</p>

<p>Bebop brings together the two most efficient trading models in DeFi:<br>
- Request-for-quote (RFQ) with professional market makers, and<br>
- Intent based system that creates auctions for independent on-chain aggregation algorithms (solvers) – Bebop JAM</p>

<p>We have three APIs that are core to our product: <br>
1) <strong>PMM</strong>, which gives the best route from our private market maker liquidity, <br>
2) <strong>JAM</strong>, which gives the best routes from solvers solving on-chain, and <br>
3) our <strong>Router API</strong>, which brings forward the best between the two.</p>

<p>If you’re trading on our UI, we are showing you the best quote from the Bebop Router – so this could be coming from either JAM or PMM.</p>
