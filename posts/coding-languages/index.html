  <h1>Coding languages: What's the difference?</h1>

  <p>When you're just starting out with web development, it can feel overwhelming to hear about all the different programming languages. The truth is: <strong>there are a lot</strong> â€” and theyâ€™re all good at different things.</p>

  <p>Something that is kind of fun is that GitHub will show you a breakdown of the languages you've used in your repos. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the languages I'm currently using to build this site ðŸ‘‡</p>

  <img src="/posts/coding-languages/languages.jpg" alt="GitHub language breakdown" style="max-width:100%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:4px;">

  <h2>Languages I'm using</h2>
  <p>These are the core technologies behind my site â€” theyâ€™re the foundation of most modern websites.</p>

  <table class="simple-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Language</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>What it's used for</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>HTML</strong></td>
        <td>Markup</td>
        <td>The structure of the page â€” headings, links, paragraphs</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>CSS</strong></td>
        <td>Styling</td>
        <td>Controls how the page looks â€” colors, fonts, layout</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>JavaScript</strong></td>
        <td>Programming</td>
        <td>Adds interactivity â€” click events, animations, dynamic content</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
        <td>Data format</td>
        <td>Stores content and config â€” for example, my blog posts are listed in a <code>.json</code> file</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Tools Iâ€™m using (behind the scenes)</h2>
  <p>These arenâ€™t languages, but theyâ€™re essential for how I build and update this site.</p>

  <table class="simple-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tool</th>
        <th>What it does</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Git</strong></td>
        <td>Tracks code changes over time, so I can version my site and go back if something breaks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>GitHub</strong></td>
        <td>Hosts my site online and lets others see the code</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Command line</strong></td>
        <td>Where I type Git commands like <code>git push</code> and <code>git commit</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Cursor AI</strong></td>
        <td>An AI-powered code editor that helps me write and understand code more easily</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Other common programming languages</h2>
  <p>There are tons of languages out there, and each one shines in different use cases. Here's a small sampler:</p>

  <table class="simple-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Language</th>
        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Used for</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Python</strong></td>
        <td>General-purpose</td>
        <td>Data analysis, machine learning, backends</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Java</strong></td>
        <td>General-purpose</td>
        <td>Android apps, enterprise systems</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>C++</strong></td>
        <td>Systems programming</td>
        <td>High-performance apps, game engines</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>C#</strong></td>
        <td>General-purpose</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>SQL</strong></td>
        <td>Database language</td>
        <td>Interacting with and querying databases</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>PHP</strong></td>
        <td>Web backend</td>
        <td>Powering dynamic websites (like WordPress)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>TypeScript</strong></td>
        <td>JavaScript superset</td>
        <td>JavaScript with types for better safety</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Go</strong></td>
        <td>General-purpose</td>
        <td>Fast backends and command-line tools</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Rust</strong></td>
        <td>Systems programming</td>
        <td>Safe and efficient low-level code</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>What are libraries and frameworks?</h2>
  <p>When a language gets really popular (like JavaScript), people start building tools <strong>on top of it</strong> to make life easier. These are called <strong>libraries</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>library</strong> is like a toolbox â€” it gives you pieces to use in your own project (you stay in control).</li>
    <li>A <strong>framework</strong> is like a partially-built house â€” you fill in the details, but the structure and rules are already defined.</li>
  </ul>

  <table class="simple-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Built with</th>
        <th>What it does</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>React</strong></td>
        <td>JavaScript</td>
        <td>Helps you build user interfaces using components</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Next.js</strong></td>
        <td>JavaScript + React</td>
        <td>Adds routing, server rendering, and performance tools</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Vue</strong></td>
        <td>JavaScript</td>
        <td>Another UI framework, often compared to React</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong></td>
        <td>CSS</td>
        <td>A utility-first framework for styling HTML faster</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Node.js</strong></td>
        <td>JavaScript</td>
        <td>Lets you run JS on the backend (e.g., for APIs or servers)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
  <p>You donâ€™t need to learn everything at once. Start with the basics â€” like HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript â€” and build from there.</p>

  <p>As your projects grow, you'll naturally run into new tools, languages, or frameworks that make your life easier. This post is here to demystify the landscape and give you a foundation to build on.</p>

  <p>Eventually I'd love to explore some of these frameworks, but for now I am keeping things basic. At Bebop, I know our engineers are using Next.js and React. Hopefully, this exercise helps me better understand what they're doing.</p>
