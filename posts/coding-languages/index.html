    <h1>🧠 Coding languages: What's the difference?</h1>
  
    <p>When you're just starting out with web development, it can feel overwhelming to hear about all the different programming languages. The truth is: <strong>there are a lot</strong> — and they’re all good at different things.</p>
  
    <p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the languages I'm currently using to build this site 👇</p>
  
    <h2>🛠️ Languages I'm using</h2>
    <p>These are the core technologies behind my site — they’re the foundation of most modern websites.</p>
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Language</th>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>What it's used for</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>HTML</strong></td>
          <td>Markup</td>
          <td>The structure of the page — headings, links, paragraphs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>CSS</strong></td>
          <td>Styling</td>
          <td>Controls how the page looks — colors, fonts, layout</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>JavaScript</strong></td>
          <td>Programming</td>
          <td>Adds interactivity — click events, animations, dynamic content</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
          <td>Data format</td>
          <td>Stores content and config — for example, my blog posts are listed in a <code>.json</code> file</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <h2>🧰 Tools I’m using (behind the scenes)</h2>
    <p>These aren’t languages, but they’re essential for how I build and update this site.</p>
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Tool</th>
          <th>What it does</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Git</strong></td>
          <td>Tracks code changes over time, so I can version my site and go back if something breaks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>GitHub</strong></td>
          <td>Hosts my site online and lets others see the code</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Command line</strong></td>
          <td>Where I type Git commands like <code>git push</code> and <code>git commit</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Cursor AI</strong></td>
          <td>An AI-powered code editor that helps me write and understand code more easily</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <h2>🌍 Other common programming languages</h2>
    <p>There are tons of languages out there, and each one shines in different use cases. Here's a small sampler:</p>
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Language</th>
          <th>Category</th>
          <th>Used for</th>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <h2>⚛️ What are libraries and frameworks?</h2>
    <p>When a language gets really popular (like JavaScript), people start building tools <strong>on top of it</strong> to make life easier. These are called <strong>libraries</strong> and <strong>frameworks</strong>.</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>library</strong> is like a toolbox — it gives you pieces to use in your own project (you stay in control).</li>
      <li>A <strong>framework</strong> is like a partially-built house — you fill in the details, but the structure and rules are already defined.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Built with</th>
          <th>What it does</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>React</strong></td>
          <td>JavaScript</td>
          <td>Helps you build user interfaces using components</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Next.js</strong></td>
          <td>JavaScript + React</td>
          <td>Adds routing, server rendering, and performance tools</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Vue</strong></td>
          <td>JavaScript</td>
          <td>Another UI framework, often compared to React</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong></td>
          <td>CSS</td>
          <td>A utility-first framework for styling HTML faster</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Node.js</strong></td>
          <td>JavaScript</td>
          <td>Lets you run JS on the backend (e.g., for APIs or servers)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <h2>🧾 Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>You don’t need to learn everything at once. Start with the basics — like HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript — and build from there.</p>
  
    <p>As your projects grow, you'll naturally run into new tools, languages, or frameworks that make your life easier. This post is here to demystify the landscape and give you a foundation to build on.</p>
  
    <p>Eventually I'd love to explore some of these frameworks, but for now I am keeping things basic. At Bebop, I know our engineers are using Next.js and React. Hopefully, this exercise helps me better understand what they're doing.</p>
