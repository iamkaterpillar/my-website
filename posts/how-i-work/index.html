<h1>How I work and communicate</h1>
<p>I had a colleague join Bebop who sent a guide like this about how they work and operate, and I think it was super handy for understanding how you can best work with someone. Here is mine:</p>

<h2>How I work and communicate</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Kat! This guide outlines how I like to work, communicate, &amp; collaborate. My goal is to reduce friction, avoid bottlenecks, and keep things moving efficiently. I hope this guide gives you insight into my work style so we can be better teammates and move fast together. üëç</p>

<h2>üß† How I think about work</h2>
<p>My approach to work is guided by a few key principles:</p>

<img src="/posts/how-i-work/how-i-work-2.jpeg" alt="Work principles illustration" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:2rem 0;" />

<h3>1. Speed &amp; efficiency</h3>
<p>0-Inbox: üëå I check Slack, email, and messages constantly ‚Äî first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and throughout the day. If you message me, I will see it. If I don't reply, I'm likely deep in work, but feel free to follow up.</p>
<p>Don't waste time: I don't like pointless meetings that could have been a message. I prefer async over sync whenever possible. If a meeting is necessary, I value clear agendas &amp; punctuality.</p>
<p>Eliminate bottlenecks: I hate bottlenecks. If I notice something slowing down progress, I'll automate it, document it, or flag it to be addressed. I like to empower people to find information on their own, so documentation is important to me.</p>

<h3>2. Transparency, ownership, &amp; clarity</h3>
<p>Transparency: I value transparency (probably even over-transparency) because it builds trust, strengthens the team dynamic, and empowers individuals. When people have access to information, they can make better decisions, feel more connected, and contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p>Ownership: I believe in ownership. If something is your responsibility, I expect you to manage it. If something's blocking you, say it early. I respect people who take initiative, follow through, and don't wait for permission.</p>
<p>Context, not guesswork: If you send me a message, please provide full context (links, docs, etc.). I will try to do the same for you. I dislike when people assume everyone has the context to what is going on with their work. A little context goes a long way.</p>
<p>Plz don't send "Hey": One of my biggest pet peeves is when people message me with "Hey" and nothing else. I've read your "Hey" and now I'm just waiting watching you type. Just say what you need, like:</p>
<p><em>‚ùå "Hey"</em></p>
<p><em>‚úÖ "Hey Kat, I'm working on X and need your input on Y. Are you free to chat at 3 PM?"</em> (For more on this, see: <a href="https://nohello.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Hello</a>)</p>

<h3>3. Prioritization &amp; realism</h3>
<p>Realist &gt; dreamer: For better or for worse, I'm focused on what needs to happen in the next 6 months, not 1-2 years from now. I think it's important to know where the product/company is going but it doesn't make sense to talk extensively about specifics for something we won't start for months, especially as things will likely change anyways (especially in crypto).</p>
<p>Data-driven decisions: While I don't consider myself ultra-analytical, I believe decisions should be driven by data wherever possible. Show me the numbers, and I'm on board.</p>

<h3>4. Boundaries &amp; balance</h3>
<p>Respect time: I check my calendar daily and plan my life around it. If I skip the gym for an early meeting that gets canceled or moved at the last minute, I'll be unhappy. If you need to reschedule, please do it early.</p>
<p>Home office: I prefer WFH because it makes my gym schedule easier, avoids commuting, and keeps me healthier (no free food at the office). I also often work late and would rather eat dinner at home &amp; then continue work.</p>
<p>No cold calls plz: üö´If you want to chat, message me first before calling. If you walk up to my desk in Gather, I probably won't even hear you because I often have the sound off. Just ping me &amp; we can hop on a call. Why do you want to stand there saying "hello" to a muted computer?</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How I work</h2>

<img src="/posts/how-i-work/how-i-work-3.jpeg" alt="Work tools and systems illustration" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:2rem 0;" />

<h3>Daily schedule</h3>
<p>Mornings: I check messages (Slack, Telegram, etc.) for 30-45 minutes after waking up. Then I head to the gym. After the gym, I usually take the stand-up or dive into work.</p>
<p>Work hours: I'm online and working during the day, but I often also work late evenings if something needs to get done. I usually work through lunch. If I'm offline, it's likely for focused work or personal time, but I'll still check messages.</p>
<p>0-Inbox: I check messages frequently and clear them quickly. If you message me on Slack, Telegram, or WhatsApp ‚Äî I'll see it. So if you're writing to me on the weekend or late at night, it'll likely be distracting from personal time. If it's not pressing, please just automate it for Monday.</p>

<h3>Tools &amp; Systems</h3>
<p>To-do lists: My life is ruled by to-do lists. If it's not on my list, it doesn't exist. I probably even have a to-do list of tasks that I would love for you to work on. I hate letting things build up on my list and I get pleasure from crossing items off.</p>
<p>Automation: I love automation. If you're on vacation, I'll schedule a message to ping you at 9 AM on your first day back. If a task is repetitive, I'll find a way to automate it.</p>
<p>Organization: I'm very organized and use Telegram folders, tags, and structured notes to keep things clear. I document processes and systems so no one is left guessing.</p>

<h3>My approach to work</h3>
<p>Solution-first thinking: If something's broken, I focus on "How do we fix it?" rather than complaining. I prefer that people come with a solution or proposal, even if it's rough.</p>
<p>Mistakes = Learning: I have no problem admitting if I've made a mistake ‚Äî we all do. I see mistakes as opportunities to learn, improve, and move forward. It's about progress, not perfection.</p>
<p>Going beyooond (because I care ü´∂): I'll often step outside of my defined scope to do what's best for the team. Whether it's creating onboarding guides, handling a tweet, or supporting customer requests ‚Äî I'll do it because I care. But, I'd like it to be recognized that I'm going above and beyond. I'm happy to help, but I don't want this work to be taken for granted or expected as a given.</p>

<h3>Some of my downfalls</h3>
<p>I can get defensive (but I'm wooorking on it): I care a lot about my work, especially when it comes to softer skills like organization, process, and operational efficiency, which I believe are essential for a cohesive team environment. I can get defensive or feel undervalued if this work isn't taken seriously or appreciated. I'm aware of this and I'm working on it, but I'd love it if people recognized how crucial these contributions are to the team's success.</p>
<p>I'll remind you: I appreciate it when people own their work and don't need constant reminders. If something is yours to handle, I trust you to manage it. If I have to step in and keep following up, I'll do it (and I'll likely have it tracked on my to-do list anyway), but it's frustrating when it feels avoidable. I believe in proactive communication, and I respect those who can manage their own responsibilities. Repeatedly chasing people for updates isn't something I enjoy, and I'm working on being more patient when it happens.</p>

<h2>üí¨ How I communicate</h2>

<img src="/posts/how-i-work/how-i-work-4.jpeg" alt="Communication style illustration" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:2rem 0;" />

<h3>Preferred style</h3>
<p>Just use slack threads: üôè Threads keep discussions together. It's easier to review later, and I can see the full history of a topic.</p>
<p>1 message, not 15: If you have multiple points, don't send them as 15 small pings. Combine them into one message with clear structure. I'll read it all at once.</p>
<p>Direct &amp; clear: I dislike passive-aggressive messages like "?". Just ask the question, e.g., "Hey Kat, any update on X?" I'll always respond to direct and clear requests.</p>
<p>Written over verbal: I think best in writing, not on the spot. Written communication allows me to be more thoughtful and thorough.</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>This guide reflects how I work right now, from my perspective. If you have feedback on how I work or suggestions for how I can make this guide more helpful for you or others, please share them. I'm always open to improving how we work together.</p>
