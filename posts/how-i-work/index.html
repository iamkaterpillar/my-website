<h1>How I work and communicate</h1>
<p>I had a colleague join Bebop who sent a guide like this about how they work and operate, and I think it was super handy for understanding how you can best work with someone. Here is mine:</p>

<h2>How I work and communicate</h2>
<p>This guide outlines how I like to work, communicate, &amp; collaborate. My goal is to reduce friction, avoid bottlenecks, and keep things moving efficiently. I hope this guide gives you insight into my work style so we can be better teammates and move fast together. üëç</p>

<h2>üß† How I think about work</h2>
<p>My approach to work is guided by a few key principles:</p>

<h3>1. Speed &amp; efficiency</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>0-Inbox:</strong> üëå I check Slack, email, and messages constantly ‚Äî first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and throughout the day. If you message me, I will see it. If I don't reply, I'm likely deep in work, but feel free to follow up.</li>
  <li><strong>Wasted time:</strong> I don't like meetings that could have been a message. I prefer async over sync whenever possible. Of course meetings are great but it's good to at least have some rough agenda in mind of what we want to cover.</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate bottlenecks:</strong> I hate bottlenecks. If I notice something slowing down progress, I'll automate it, document it, or flag it to be addressed. I like to empower people to find information on their own, so documentation is important to me.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Transparency, ownership, &amp; clarity</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> I value transparency (probably even over-transparency) because it builds trust, strengthens the team dynamic, and empowers individuals. When people have access to information, they can make better decisions, feel more connected, and contribute meaningfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> I believe in ownership. If something is your responsibility, I expect you to manage it. If something's blocking you, say it early. I respect people who take initiative, follow through, and don't wait for permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Context, not guesswork:</strong> If you send me a message, please provide full context (links, docs, etc.). I will try to do the same for you. I dislike when people assume everyone has the context to what is going on with their work. A little context goes a long way.</li>
  <li><strong>Plz don't just send "Hey":</strong> One of my biggest pet peeves is when people message me with "Hey" and nothing else. I've read your "Hey" and now I'm just waiting watching you type. Just say what you need, like:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 1rem;"><em>‚ùå "Hey"</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1rem;"><em>‚úÖ "Hey Kat, I'm working on X and need your input on Y. Are you free to chat at 3 PM?"</em></p>

<h3>3. Prioritization &amp; realism</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Realist &gt; dreamer:</strong> For better or for worse, I'm focused on what needs to happen in the next 6 months, not 1-2 years from now. I think it's important to know where the product/company is going but it doesn't make sense to talk extensively about specifics for something we won't start for years, especially as things will likely change anyways (particularly in crypto).</li>
  <li><strong>Data-driven decisions:</strong> While I don't consider myself ultra-analytical, I believe decisions should be driven by data wherever possible. Show me the numbers, and I'm on board.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Boundaries &amp; balance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Respect everyone's time:</strong> I check my calendar daily and plan my life around it. If meetings are constantly canceled or moved at the last minute, I find it unproductive and not very respectful. I'm happy to reschedule, but please try to do it early.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How I work</h2>
<h3>1. Daily schedule</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mornings:</strong> I check messages (Slack, Telegram, etc.) for 30-45 minutes after waking up. Then I head to the gym. After the gym, I usually take the stand-up or dive into work.</li>
  <li><strong>Work hours:</strong> I'm online and working during the day, but I often also work late evenings if something needs to get done. I usually work through lunch. If I'm offline, it's likely for focused work or personal time, but I'll still check messages.</li>
  <li><strong>0-Inbox:</strong> I check messages frequently and clear them quickly. If you message me on Slack, Telegram, or WhatsApp ‚Äî I'll see it. So if you're writing to me on the weekend or late at night, it'll likely be distracting from personal time. If it's not pressing, please just automate it for Monday.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Tools &amp; Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>To-do lists:</strong> My life is ruled by to-do lists. If it's not on my list, it doesn't exist. I probably even have a to-do list of tasks that I would love for you to work on. I hate letting things build up on my list and I get pleasure from crossing items off.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation:</strong> I love automation. If you're on vacation, I'll schedule a message to ping you at 9 AM on your first day back. If a task is repetitive, I'll find a way to automate it.</li>
  <li><strong>Organization:</strong> I'm very organized and use Telegram folders, tags, and structured notes to keep things clear. I document processes and systems so no one is left guessing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. My approach to work</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Solution-first thinking:</strong> If something's broken, I focus on "How do we fix it?" rather than complaining. I prefer that people come with a solution or proposal, even if it's rough.</li>
  <li><strong>Mistakes = Learning:</strong> I have no problem admitting if I've made a mistake ‚Äî we all do. I see mistakes as opportunities to learn, improve, and move forward. It's about progress, not perfection.</li>
  <li><strong>I carea lot:</strong> I'll sometimes step outside of my defined scope to do what's best for the team. Whether it's creating onboarding guides, handling a tweet, or supporting customer requests ‚Äî I'll do it because I care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üí¨ How I communicate</h2>

<h3>Preferred style</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Just use slack threads:</strong> üôè Threads keep discussions together. It's easier to review later, and I can see the full history of a topic.</li>
  <li><strong>1 message, not 15:</strong> If you have multiple points, don't send them as 15 small pings. Combine them into one message with clear structure. I'll read it all at once.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct &amp; clear:</strong> I dislike passive-aggressive messages like "?". Just ask the question, e.g., "Hey Kat, any update on X?" I'll always respond to direct and clear requests.</li>
  <li><strong>Written over verbal:</strong> I think best in writing, not on the spot. Written communication allows me to be more thoughtful and thorough.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>If you have feedback on how I work or suggestions for how I can make this guide more helpful for you or others, please share them. I'm always open to improving how we work together.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this!<br>‚Äî Kat</p>
