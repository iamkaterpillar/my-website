<h1>Lessons as a PM</h1>

<p>When I left consulting to get my MBA, I thought I had a good grasp of what being a product manager meant. I even took a PM class at LBS, learned the frameworks, and built fake roadmaps for hypothetical apps. But nothing prepared me for what it would be like to become a PM at Bebop — building a deeply technical crypto product in a space where most users tolerate (or expect) bad UX.</p>

<p>It was a steep learning curve. And while I'm still learning every day, here are the top 10 lessons I've picked up so far.</p>

<p><em>Note: These are my experiences from working on a crypto product at a lean startup — which, granted, is quite different from working in most industries or at a large company.</em></p>

<h2>1. Document everything. If you don't, it didn't happen.</h2>
<p>We'd change direction on a feature, fix a bug, or cut a scope — and months later, nobody could remember why. Unless I had it in Confluence or someone left a comment in the code, we were left second-guessing ourselves.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Lesson:</strong> Even a few bullet points in Slack or Confluence can save hours later. Don't assume you'll remember. You won't.</p>

<h2>2. Involve engineers early — way earlier than you think</h2>
<p>One of the best habits we tried to get into was looping engineers into product discussions before designs were finalized. It helped us avoid technically infeasible ideas and built stronger ownership from the team.</p>
<p>🛠️ <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Create a habit of 3-way syncs between product, design, and engineering early. It builds trust and prevents costly rewrites later.</p>

<h2>3. Start small. You can always grow a feature later.</h2>
<p>We wasted time over-engineering flows that never got used. Now, we aim to validate the smallest possible version and iterate.</p>
<p>🪴 <strong>Mantra:</strong> Don't gold-plate a maybe. Ship the version that answers: "Is this worth continuing?"</p>

<h2>4. Usage analytics are your product superpower</h2>
<p>You can debate what feature to build — or you can look at the data. Once we started tracking real usage properly, it completely changed how we built.</p>
<p>📊 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Track early, track cleanly. Funnels > clicks. Contextual insights > vanity metrics.</p>

<h2>5. Write specs for yourself, not just engineers</h2>
<p>Specs aren't just a communication tool — they're a forcing function. If I couldn't write out edge cases clearly, it usually meant I didn't understand them yet.</p>
<p>📝 <strong>Tip:</strong> Treat PRDs as living documents. Keep them readable, structured, and full of diagrams or examples.</p>

<h2>6. Ship it, then polish</h2>
<p>We used to over-polish before launch, waiting for "perfect." Now we ship earlier and improve with real usage feedback.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Reminder:</strong> A perfect feature no one uses is worth less than an MVP people can react to.</p>

<h2>7. It may not be fun, but we need design QA</h2>
<p>QA often feels thankless, but it sets the tone for quality. Letting small inconsistencies slide leads to bigger sloppiness later.</p>
<p>🔍 <strong>Advice:</strong> Pick your battles, but be consistent. You're not nitpicking — you're shaping product culture.</p>

<h2>8. Releases are hard no matter how you do it</h2>
<p>We tried everything — fixed sprints, rolling deploys, release branches. No system is perfect. I've talked about this with PM friends at other companies too. Once you have more than a few devs, it's just hard, and no matter how you manage it, someone will always need to rebase.</p>
<p>🚢 <strong>What I learned:</strong> The key is clarity. Know what's shipping, who owns what, and how to fix fast when something breaks.</p>

<h2>9. Ops glue work is real product work</h2>
<p>When the team is small, the PM often becomes the person connecting the dots — managing docs, onboarding, checklists, standups, policies. It's not glamorous, but it keeps the machine running.</p>
<p>🧩 <strong>Note to self:</strong> Helping the team stay unblocked and aligned is just as important as writing specs.</p>

<h2>10. You don't have to be technical — but you do have to care to learn</h2>
<p>I didn't come from an engineering background. But I read every spec, asked "dumb" questions, and pushed myself to learn. Eventually, I could speak the language — not fluently, but enough to collaborate deeply.</p>
<p>⚙️ <strong>Encouragement:</strong> Curiosity, clarity, and persistence matter more than knowing how to code.</p>

<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Being a PM at Bebop has been one of the hardest, most rewarding experiences of my career. I've made mistakes, learned the hard way, and grown into the role by being in the fire — not just studying it from a distance.</p>

<p>I'm deeply grateful for everything I've learned along the way, and now more curious than ever to see how other products are managed — especially outside of crypto.</p>

<p>People often say PMs are like the "CEO of the product," but that's only true if you embrace all of it: the ambiguity, the pressure, the glue work, the user pain, and the joy of getting something live — even when it's imperfect.</p>
