  <h1>Let's talk about Ondo Finance</h1>

  <p>Last week, I was back home visiting my parents in the Bay Area. I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, but despite the tech-soaked surroundings, our home is not a particularly crypto-forward household. My dad is retired and rightfully risk-averse. He's skeptical of most things blockchain-related, and understandably so. Crypto has a reputation problem.</p>

  <p>What started as a chat about U.S. Treasury bills over coffee quickly turned into a chat about Ondo Finance. Unlike many crypto projects, Ondo isn't promising meme-driven riches or cartoon JPEGs. It's doing something far more practical, bringing real-world assets (RWAs) like U.S. Treasuries onchain.</p>

  <p>I often learn best by writing things out. So this is my attempt to explain what Ondo is, why RWAs matter, and how this all fits into a much larger shift happening in decentralized finance.</p>

  <h2>Why I like Ondo</h2>

  <p>Despite working in crypto for the last four years, I consider myself a pretty risk-averse investor. I've been investing for over a decade — mostly in diversified ETFs like SPY (S&P 500). My crypto holdings are small, mostly BTC, ETH, and SOL, held on centralized exchanges. I only started dabbling in DeFi to better understand the landscape and test the product I helped build at Bebop.</p>

  <p>But meme coins? Not for me.</p>

  <p>So when I came across Ondo, I was intrigued. Here was a crypto-native product that wasn't trying to YOLO your savings into a speculative token. It was offering a blockchain-powered version of something conservative investors already love: T-bills.</p>

  <p><strong>The pitch: why earn 0% on USDC when you could earn 5% on USDY?</strong></p>

  <p>In today's uncertain economy — with inflation volatility, rising interest rates, and a returning Trump presidency — everyone is rethinking where to park their money. T-bills have long been the safest option. And now, thanks to Ondo, they're available onchain.</p>

  <h2>What Ondo offers</h2>

  <p>Ondo's value prop is simple: combine the efficiency of blockchains with the reliability of traditional assets. The company has two standout products — USDY and OUSG — both tied to U.S. Treasuries.</p>

  <h3>USDY</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A token backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries</li>
    <li>Issued under a Reg S exemption (non-U.S. holders only)</li>
    <li>Accrues yield via price appreciation (starts at $1.00 and increases as interest accumulates)</li>
    <li>Redeemable and tradable onchain 24/7</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>OUSG</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Tokenized exposure to BlackRock's SHV ETF (short-term Treasury ETF)</li>
    <li>Tradable by both U.S. and non-U.S. investors</li>
    <li>Available via Coinbase Prime and other institutional platforms</li>
    <li>Also gaining momentum in DeFi protocols like Flux</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>USDY vs OUSG: What's the difference?</h2>

  <h2>So... who cares about Ondo?</h2>

  <p>Well, not my dad — not yet, anyway. But a lot of others do.</p>

  <h3>Retail investors (non-U.S.)</h3>
  <p>USDY is a compelling asset for yield-hungry users around the world. In countries with inflation-prone currencies or restricted access to U.S. markets, USDY offers 5%+ yield, daily transparency, and the freedom of onchain movement.</p>

  <h3>Institutions</h3>
  <p>Ondo has drawn the attention of institutional partners by anchoring its products in familiar TradFi structures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BlackRock:</strong> OUSG's underlying asset</li>
    <li><strong>Coinbase Prime:</strong> Institutional access and custody</li>
    <li><strong>DeFi integrations:</strong> Lending, collateral, and trading use cases via Flux, Mantle, Solana, and Base</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>DeFi protocols</h3>
  <p>USDY is being used across DeFi for lending, staking, and liquidity provision. It's programmable money, backed by real-world yield, that doesn't just sit idle — it works.</p>

  <h2>Beyond tokens: Ondo's bigger mission</h2>

  <p>Ondo isn't just issuing yield coins — it's building infrastructure. Its cross-chain bridge enables tokenized RWAs to move seamlessly across ecosystems. It's laying the groundwork for a global, composable financial system — one where U.S. Treasuries can be accessed anywhere, anytime, by anyone.</p>

  <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

  <p>We're still in the early innings of RWAs. But Ondo is showing what's possible when you combine regulatory clarity, great design, and blockchain rails. For cautious investors like my dad — and DeFi natives like me — that's something worth paying attention to.</p>
