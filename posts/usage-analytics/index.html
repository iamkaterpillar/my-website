<h1>Setting up Google Analytics for my personal site (and why you should too)</h1>

<p>If you’ve built a personal website, blog, or portfolio, it’s fun and actually super useful to know if anyone is visiting it — and where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>That’s where usage analytics come in. They help you answer questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many people are visiting my site?</li>
  <li>Which pages are most popular?</li>
  <li>Where are visitors coming from (e.g. Twitter, Google, random internet magic)?</li>
  <li>What devices or browsers are people using?</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t need to be a data nerd to appreciate those insights — even knowing that someone out there found your site is kind of motivating when you're just starting out.</p>

<h2>Why I chose Google Analytics</h2>

<p>I went with Google Analytics (GA) because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s free</li>
  <li>It’s easy to set up</li>
  <li>And it’s very powerful if you want to get deeper down the road</li>
</ul>

<p>There are alternatives (like Plausible, Fathom, or Simple Analytics) that are more privacy-focused or simpler, but for a basic project, GA is a great starting point.</p>

<h2>How to set up Google Analytics (GA4) on your site</h2>

<h3>1. Create a Google Analytics account</h3>

<p>Go to <a href="https://analytics.google.com">analytics.google.com</a> and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Start measuring</strong></li>
  <li>Create an account and a property (you can call it something like "My Website")</li>
  <li>Follow the steps to set up a web data stream</li>
  <li>You’ll get a <strong>Measurement ID</strong> that looks like <code>G-XXXXXXXXXX</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Add the GA script to your site</h3>

<p>Paste the following code inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of your <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- Google tag (gtag.js) --&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Replace <code>G-XXXXXXXXXX</code> with your actual Measurement ID.</em></p>

<h2>How to check if it’s working</h2>

<p>After you publish your site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open your site in Chrome</li>
  <li>Right-click → Inspect → Go to the <strong>Network</strong> tab</li>
  <li>Reload the page and look for a request to <code>gtag/js?id=...</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If it shows up (ideally with a <code>200</code> status), it means the script is loading. If it fails at first, don’t panic — it might just take a little time for Google to activate your new property.</p>

<p>You can also check Google Analytics → Realtime to see if your visit shows up.</p>

<h2>What happens once it's working?</h2>

<p>You’ll start seeing dashboards with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Realtime visitors</li>
  <li>Traffic sources</li>
  <li>Device/browser data</li>
  <li>Page views and more</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this info to figure out what’s resonating with people and where you might want to tweak things.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Setting up analytics might feel like overkill for a personal site — but it’s not! It's fun, motivating, and gives you a peek into how people engage with your little corner of the web.</p>
