# Setting up Google Analytics for my personal site (and why you should too)

If you’ve built a personal website, blog, or portfolio, it’s fun and actually super useful to know if anyone is visiting it — and where they’re coming from.

That’s where usage analytics come in. They help you answer questions like:

- How many people are visiting my site?
- Which pages are most popular?
- Where are visitors coming from (e.g. Twitter, Google, random internet magic)?
- What devices or browsers are people using?

You don’t need to be a data nerd to appreciate those insights — even knowing that someone out there found your site is kind of motivating when you're just starting out.

## Why I chose Google Analytics

I went with Google Analytics (GA) because:

- It’s free  
- It’s easy to set up  
- And it’s very powerful if you want to get deeper down the road

There are alternatives (like Plausible, Fathom, or Simple Analytics) that are more privacy-focused or simpler, but for a basic project, GA is a great starting point.

## How to set up Google Analytics (GA4) on your site

### 1. Create a Google Analytics account

Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com) and:

- Click **Start measuring**
- Create an account and a property (you can call it something like "My Website")
- Follow the steps to set up a web data stream
- You’ll get a Measurement ID that looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`

### 2. Add the GA script to your site

Paste the following code inside the `<head>` tag of your `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID.

## 3. How to check if it’s working

After you publish your site:

- Open your site in Chrome
- Right-click → Inspect → Go to the **Network** tab
- Reload the page and look for a request to `gtag/js?id=...`

If it shows up (ideally with a **200** status), it means the script is loading.  
If it fails at first, don’t panic — it might just take a little time for Google to activate your new property.

You can also check **Google Analytics → Realtime** to see if your visit shows up.

## 4. What happens once it's working?

You’ll start seeing dashboards with:

- Realtime visitors  
- Traffic sources  
- Device/browser data  
- Page views and more

You can use this info to figure out what’s resonating with people and where you might want to tweak things.

## 5. Final thoughts

Setting up analytics might feel like overkill for a personal site — but it’s not!  
It's fun, motivating, and gives you a peek into how people engage with your little corner of the web.
