  <h1>Using AI agents in Cursor</h1>

  <p>When I first started building this website, I was using VS Code as my editor. But after hearing so many recommendations about Cursor and its AI capabilities, I decided to give it a try. Here's what I've learned about using AI agents to improve my code.</p>

  <h2>What is Cursor?</h2>
  <p>Cursor is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built with AI at its core. It's like VS Code, but with powerful AI features that can help you write, understand, and improve your code.</p>

  <h2>How I'm using AI agents</h2>
  <p>Here are some ways I've been using Cursor's AI capabilities while building this site:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Code cleanup:</strong> The AI agent helps identify and fix inconsistencies in my code style and structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature implementation:</strong> When adding new features, the AI suggests best practices and helps write efficient code.</li>
    <li><strong>Bug fixing:</strong> The AI can analyze error messages and suggest potential fixes.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning:</strong> By explaining its suggestions, the AI helps me understand why certain approaches are better than others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recent improvements</h2>
  <p>Here are some recent improvements I've made to the site with help from Cursor's AI:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reorganized the file structure for better maintainability</li>
    <li>Added proper meta tags for SEO and social sharing</li>
    <li>Implemented responsive design patterns</li>
    <li>Created a consistent styling system</li>
    <li>Added social media integration with SVG icons</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips for working with AI agents</h2>
  <p>If you're new to using AI in your development workflow, here are some tips I've learned:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> The more specific your requests, the better the AI's responses will be.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify suggestions:</strong> Always review and understand the code the AI suggests before implementing it.</li>
    <li><strong>Use it for learning:</strong> Ask the AI to explain its suggestions - it's a great way to learn best practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Begin with simple tasks and gradually work up to more complex features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
  <p>I'm excited to continue exploring how AI can help improve my development process. Some areas I'm particularly interested in:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Automated testing suggestions</li>
    <li>Performance optimization recommendations</li>
    <li>Accessibility improvements</li>
    <li>Code documentation generation</li>
  </ul>
