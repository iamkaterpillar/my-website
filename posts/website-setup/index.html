<h1>Website setup</h1>
<p>Building this site has been a long time coming. I’ve owned the domain <code>iamkaterpillar.xyz</code> for years — always with the idea of making a personal site, but never quite finding the time or energy. That changed recently when I decided to finally go for it — and document the process along the way.</p>
<p>This post is about the first steps: registering a domain, setting up hosting, and getting those first files live.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Getting a domain</h2>
<p>You can use any domain provider here — GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, whatever works for you. I happened to already have mine, <code>iamkaterpillar.xyz</code>, sitting unused from a while back.</p>
<p>If you’re starting fresh, you’ll just need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a name you like</li>
  <li>Make sure it's available</li>
  <li>Register it (usually costs ~$10–15/year)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Choose your hosting</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of ways to host a personal website. I went with <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s free</li>
  <li>It’s super easy to use</li>
  <li>I already had a GitHub account</li>
</ul>
<p>You just push your files to a GitHub repo and it handles the rest. If you’re not comfortable with GitHub yet, there are also great beginner-friendly hosts like Netlify or Vercel.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Set up your tools</h2>
<p>I started with the basics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>iTerm</strong> for my terminal</li>
  <li><strong>Cursor</strong> (an AI-enhanced VS Code fork) for writing code</li>
</ul>
<p>Very quickly, I started using <strong>Cursor AI</strong> heavily — it suggests code completions and helps debug as you type. You can hit <code>Tab</code> to accept suggestions, and it’s great for solo projects like this one.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Get your first files live</h2>
<p>I asked ChatGPT (hi!) to help me scaffold the basic site structure. We started with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>index.html</code> – the homepage</li>
  <li><code>style.css</code> – just enough styling to make things not ugly</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, I slowly added more: <code>about.html</code>, a blog layout, JavaScript support, and markdown rendering.</p>
<p>Here’s what ChatGPT helped with initially:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic HTML boilerplate</li>
  <li>A responsive layout using flexbox</li>
  <li>Styling the typography and spacing</li>
  <li>Hooking up a simple nav bar</li>
  <li>Setting up a favicon and linking a stylesheet</li>
</ul>
<p>Even just having that minimal structure in place helped things feel real — and gave me a jumping-off point to experiment and iterate.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>You don’t need a fancy stack to get a website up and running. A domain, a GitHub repo, and a little HTML/CSS are more than enough to start. And once the foundation is there, you can build as much or as little as you want.</p>
<p>This site is still evolving, but it’s already been a fun playground — and a great excuse to learn some new tools.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about starting a personal site: do it. You’ll learn a ton, and it’s incredibly satisfying to type your domain into a browser and see something <em>you</em> made.</p>
