# Website setup

Building this site has been a long time coming. I’ve owned the domain `iamkaterpillar.xyz` for years — always with the idea of making a personal site, but never quite finding the time or energy. That changed recently when I decided to finally go for it — and document the process along the way.

This post is about the first steps: registering a domain, setting up hosting, and getting those first files live.

## Step 1: Getting a domain

You can use any domain provider here — GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, whatever works for you. I happened to already have mine, `iamkaterpillar.xyz`, sitting unused from a while back.

If you’re starting fresh, you’ll just need to:

- Choose a name you like
- Make sure it's available
- Register it (usually costs ~$10–15/year)

## Step 2: Choose your hosting

There are a bunch of ways to host a personal website. I went with **GitHub Pages** because:

- It’s free
- It’s super easy to use
- I already had a GitHub account

You just push your files to a GitHub repo and it handles the rest. If you’re not comfortable with GitHub yet, there are also great beginner-friendly hosts like Netlify or Vercel.

## Step 3: Set up your tools

I started with the basics:

- **iTerm** for my terminal
- **Cursor** (an AI-enhanced VS Code fork) for writing code

Very quickly, I started using **Cursor AI** heavily — it suggests code completions and helps debug as you type. You can hit `Tab` to accept suggestions, and it’s great for solo projects like this one.

## Step 4: Get your first files live

I asked ChatGPT (hi!) to help me scaffold the basic site structure. We started with:

- `index.html` – the homepage
- `style.css` – just enough styling to make things not ugly

From there, I slowly added more: `about.html`, a blog layout, JavaScript support, and markdown rendering.

Here’s what ChatGPT helped with initially:

- Basic HTML boilerplate
- A responsive layout using flexbox
- Styling the typography and spacing
- Hooking up a simple nav bar
- Setting up a favicon and linking a stylesheet

Even just having that minimal structure in place helped things feel real — and gave me a jumping-off point to experiment and iterate.

## Final thoughts

You don’t need a fancy stack to get a website up and running. A domain, a GitHub repo, and a little HTML/CSS are more than enough to start. And once the foundation is there, you can build as much or as little as you want.

This site is still evolving, but it’s already been a fun playground — and a great excuse to learn some new tools.

If you’re thinking about starting a personal site: do it. You’ll learn a ton, and it’s incredibly satisfying to type your domain into a browser and see something *you* made.
